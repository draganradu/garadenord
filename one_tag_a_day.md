# One tag a day keeps the developer away

There are **100** HTML 5 valid tags and i was wondering could I use all of them in one site. It's a silly question I know, there are some that I have already used in the project, but could I use the rest of them?

Some of them I can't even remember ever using, and some I have never used, 1 a day would surely keep me busy the better part of a year.

## 1 Day:  \<a>

I used this tag for links and nothing else.

[icon](./src/components/icon.vue)

``` html
<a>link</a>
```

Did i use it before: **no**
Is it usefull: **no**
Tag count: **1546**
